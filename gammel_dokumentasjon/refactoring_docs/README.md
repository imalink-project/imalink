## Historical Context

Key refactoring phases documented here:
1. **Photo-centric import** - Shifted from file-centric to photo-centric model
2. **Hotpreview system** - Renamed hotpreview → hotpreview
3. **Schema updates** - Various database field migrations
4. **Import architecture** - Multiple iterations of import system design

These patterns and learnings informed the current desktop-first architecture.
